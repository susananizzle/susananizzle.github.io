	<h2>	Hobbies </h2>
	<p>		My hobbies are based on creativity. It is either sketching, painting, building, or writing. I got my creativity from my mother who is always working on a new "project". Improving the house with homemade furniture or building a shed in the backyard. </p>

	<h2>	Family </h2>
		<article>
	<p>	   My family is everything to me. No matter how crazy they are, we will always be there for eachother. I have two older brothers, I am the youngest and only girl. My parents are divorced therefore I live with my step-dad and my mom, but that doesnt stop the adventures I have with my dad, From canoeing to traveling to six states in a motorhome. Though my family is...unique they are certainly a blessing
