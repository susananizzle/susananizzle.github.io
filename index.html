	<p>	   My family is everything to me. No matter how crazy they are, we will always be there for eachother. I have two older brothers, I am the youngest and only girl. My parents are divorced therefore I live with my step-dad and my mom, but that doesnt stop the adventures I have with my dad, From canoeing to traveling to six states in a motorhome. Though my family is...unique they are certainly a blessing
