		<h1> My Future </h1>
	
	<h2> High School </h2>
	<img itemprop="image" data-original=”images/classroom.jpg” align=”right” /><p> A high school i’m planning to attend is Lakewood. I applied for the odyssey program which is practically based on the environment. From marine animals to agriculture. My second program at lakewood that i have requested is Merit Scholar which is based on time organization and honor classes.</p>
	
		
	<h2> College   </h2>
	 <p> At the moment I have no idea what college i would want to go to, I never thought of it. </p>

	<h2> Career Interest </h2> 
		<p>  Im unsure what i wish to do as a career. I'm still trying to find myself and my interests. I can see myself as a teacher in the future. Teaching to a younger generation and making a change into their lives is always a plus. </p>
